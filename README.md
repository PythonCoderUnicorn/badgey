## Setup

- download the repo
- install the libraries in the `requirements.txt` which will allow you to hear Badgey ask you the question

## Run program

```
python3 badgey.py
```

- user can enter `y` for a lesson on Starfleet Engineering

## Why?

There was `cowsay` and so why not have Star Trek Badgey ? Maybe this will expand on lessons and capabilities.
